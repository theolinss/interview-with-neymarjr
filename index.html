            Neymar, in full Neymar da Silva Santos, Jr., (born February 5, 1992, Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil), Brazilian football (soccer) 
            player who is one of the most prolific scorers in his country's storied football history. Neymar began playing football as
            a boy in São Vicente, under the guidance of his father, a former professional footballer who remained a close adviser and
            mentor throughout his son's career. Having played street and indoor five-a-side football, Neymar joined Portuguesa Santista's
            youth team in São Vicente, and in 2003 he and his family moved to Santos. There Neymar, who was already an impressive player,
            joined the youth academy of Santos FC (the same club for which Brazilian football legend Pelé starred over the majority
            of his domestic career). At age 14 he had a successful trial with Spain's Real Madrid, and Santos had to increase its
            spending to retain him.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;" class="nunito" id="santos">Santos</h2>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="nunito" id="one">In his debut as a professional in the main team of Santos Football Club, Neymar had already become one of the highlights of the team, becoming the revelation
             of the Paulista Championship. In that same championship, he was the best player in the following year, in the conquest of the 2010 title. In the Copa do Brasil of that 
             year, he also stood out, acquiring his second title for the club.

            In the following year, 2011, Neymar led Santos to achieve the Paulista Championship title again. That same year, he also won the Copa Libertadores da América and had the 
            possibility of competing in the FIFA Club World Cup.
            
            In 2012, Neymar became Santos' all-time top scorer after the post-Pelé era. During this period, he again won the Paulista Championship, being the top scorer of the competition.
             He also won the South American Recopa of that year. In 2013, the "jewel" of Santos left the club to play for the well-known Barcelona.</p> 
        <h2 style="text-align: center;" class="nunito">Barcelona</h2>

        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="nunito" class="career" id="two">The millionaire transfer of Neymar to Barcelona ended up becoming quite controversial. It happened officially on May 25, 2013, 
            when the disclosed value of the negotiation was 57 million euros. However, the controversy arose because the actual value was much higher, with the player having cost 
            around 86.2 million euros.

            After several important performances for the Catalan club, Neymar reached his first 50 goals for the club in March 2014. The player won several titles during his time in 
            the European team.
            
            Among them, the seasons of 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 of the Spanish Championship stand out, as well as the 2014-2015 UEFA Champions League and the 2015 FIFA Club World 
            Cup. Barcelona announced Neymar's departure from the club on August 2, 2017.
        </p>
        
        <h2 style="text-align: center;" class="nunito">Paris Saint-Germain (PSG)</h2>

        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="nunito" class="career" id="three">After leaving Barcelona, Neymar ended up in France, presented by Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) 2 days after the announcement of his
             departure from the previous club. The contract with PSG was valid until the end of June 2022. This contract has already been renewed until 2025.

            To have the Brazilian star, Paris Saint-Germain had to pay a sum of 222 million euros in a buyout clause. At that time, Neymar had just become the most expensive football 
            player in history.
            
            With PSG, Neymar won the French Championship in the 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20 seasons. In addition, he won the French Cup 3 times and the French League Cup 2 times, 
            the same number of titles as the French Super Cup. Despite this, the player's goal of winning the UEFA Champions League was not achieved, but he reached the final of the
             tournament.

        <div class="line"></div>
 
  <h4 style="text-align: center;" class="acme">
    
        Interviewer: Hi Neymar, thanks for joining us today. Let's start with a simple question - how did you first get interested in football?
    
</h4>
 <br>
 <p style="text-align: justify;" class="nunito">
    Neymar: Hi there, thanks for having me. I've been playing football since I was a little kid. I watched some matches of Pelé and wanted to be like him. I grew up around the sport 
    and fell in love with it at an early age. I started playing organized football when I was six years old and never looked back.
</p>
<br>
<h4 style="text-align: center;" class="acme">
   
        Interviewer: You've had an incredible career so far, playing for some of the biggest clubs in the world and winning numerous awards. What do you consider to be your 
        greatest achievement in football?
 </h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;" class="nunito">
        Neymar: That's a tough question. I've been fortunate to achieve a lot of my goals in football so far, but I would say winning the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015 was 
        definitely a highlight. It's the most prestigious club competition in the world and to win it with such a great team was an amazing feeling.
    </p>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;" class="acme">
        Interviewer: Speaking of great teams, you're now playing for Paris Saint-Germain. What's it been like playing for such a storied club in one of the world's 
        most beautiful cities?
    </h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;" class="nunito">
        Neymar: It's been incredible. PSG is a fantastic club with great history and a passionate fan base. And Paris is such an amazing city – 
        the culture, the food, the people – it's all so inspiring. I feel very lucky to be able to play here and be a part of such a special team.
    </p>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;" class="acme">
        Interviewer: You've been the subject of some controversy over the years, with some people accusing you of diving 
        or exaggerating fouls on the field. What's your response to those criticisms?
    </h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;" class="nunito">
        Neymar: Look, I understand that some people might not like the way I play, and that's fine. But I've always played with passion and intensity, and sometimes that means 
        going down when I get fouled. I'm not trying to deceive anyone or cheat, I'm just trying to win. And I think if people really watch me play and see 
        how hard I work, they'll understand that.
    </p>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;" class="acme">
        Interviewer: Fair enough. One last question - what advice would you give to young players who aspire to have a career like yours?
    </h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;" class="nunito">
        Neymar: My advice would be to never give up on your dreams. Football is a tough sport, and there will be a lot of challenges and setbacks along the way. But if you work hard, stay focused, and always believe in yourself, you can achieve anything you want. And remember to have fun – at the end of the day, soccer is a game, and it should always be enjoyable.
